# Reuters-21578 Text Classification

## Overview

This project performs text classification on the Reuters-21578 dataset using Logistic Regression. The dataset is preprocessed using NLP techniques, and a TF-IDF vectorization approach is applied before training the model. The evaluation includes precision, recall, F1-score, and a confusion matrix visualization.

## Features

- Text preprocessing (lowercasing, tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, lemmatization)
- Vectorization using TF-IDF and CountVectorizer
- Model training with Logistic Regression
- Model evaluation using classification metrics
- Confusion matrix visualization

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Death-Rider2468/Deep-Learning-Assignment4

## Dataset

The Reuters-21578 dataset should be placed in the project directory.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- NLTK
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Results

The model achieves high classification accuracy with precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. A confusion matrix is plotted to visualize performance.

## Contribution

Feel free to contribute by improving the preprocessing, experimenting with different models, or optimizing hyperparameters.
